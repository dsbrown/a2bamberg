	# Notes on getting UWSGI to work with NGINX
	#
	# 1) Make sure NGINX has permission to access the *.sock file.  It was necessary
	#    for me to run the command 'sudo chmod 777 /tmp/uwsgi.sock' to get it to work.
	#
	# 2) Make sure UWSGI is running, and that the app loads correctly.  I had to:
	#      a) 'workon' the virtual env it is stored in
	#      b) Start the service using the command:
	#            uwsgi -s /tmp/uwsgi.sock 
	#                 --module api 
	#				  --callable app 
	#				  --chdir /home/ubuntu/tube 
	#				  --home /home/ubuntu/tube
	#
	# 3) If the site still won't show, check the log files at:
	#		/var/log/nginx/error.log
	#    They are very descriptive about why they cannot handle requests.
	#
	# 4) Restart nginx after any config changes using the command:
	#		sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
	#
